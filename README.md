MCA - Data Structures and Algorithms Practice
Welcome to my repository for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, completed as part of my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) program. This collection serves as a personal log of my journey through learning and implementing key computer science concepts.

📖 About This Repository
This repository contains my solutions to various DSA problems. The primary goal is to practice implementing fundamental data structures and algorithms from scratch, solidifying my understanding of their time and space complexities, and preparing for technical interviews.

Languages Used: C++, Python (You can edit this)

📂 Directory Structure
All solutions are organized by the data structure or algorithm topic. Each problem has its own folder or file for clarity.

⚙️ How to Use
To run any of the solutions, navigate to the specific file and compile it using a standard compiler.

For C++:

g++ -o output_file_name ProblemFileName.cpp
./output_file_name

For Python:

python3 ProblemFileName.py

🎓 My Learning Journey
This repository is a work in progress. I am continuously adding new solutions and refining existing ones as I deepen my understanding of DSA. Feel free to explore, and if you have any suggestions, please let me know!
